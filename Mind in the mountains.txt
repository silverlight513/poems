Reason/Description:
Trying to think of topics to write about and I thought, what do I love the most. After writing a couple more troubling poems it would be nice to write something heartfelt instead of heartwrenching.


Metres:
12 syllable rhyming couplets
3 couplets per stanza
3 stanzas
each couplet needs to be a juxtaposition

Couplet topics:
1.
The intensity of overshadowing monolithic mountaints
The infancy of a single man cast under
2.
A terrifying thought if nature was quick and cast
How slow nature forms into greatness
3.


Stanza topics:
Coming to the mountains in gobsmacked awe
Heading through the mountains and finding it's wonders
Coming out the other side wiser (more at one with nature/more respectful of natures beauty)
