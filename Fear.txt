What wretched feeling fear is
A great delusion clinging closely to your heart
What enduring persistent affliction is this
The tortuous counterpart

Worries fill the mind with no room for joyous hope
Fighting fierce throughout the day with gut wrenching fire <Doesn't keep up with the theme>
Feeling unable to cope

Under shallow smiles we hide
Never do we let others know that pain we bear
Masquerading <> on which we relied
This life is solemnly fair

  Unbeknowing to you
  What is it, this fear
