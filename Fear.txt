Reason/Description:
Woke up feeling scared and stressed and it made me think of how horrible this feeling is.
I ended up getting this prose in my head about the whole ordeal:
  What wretched feeling is fear
  A delusion clinging close to your heart
  Beating faster and harder
  Unbeknowing to you
  What is it, this fear
