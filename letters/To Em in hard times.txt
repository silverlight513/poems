To Em,

We'll always be here for you
especially when you're not feeling so brave.

You're an amazing friend,
who's kindness sets our hearts ablaze

You're the vibrant rainbow juxtaposed to the sky
that still shines on the darkest of days.

Love,
Lowri & Jack

Reason/Description:
Our friend was having a hard time. So many problems thrust upon her that were not her fault so my partner and I got her a card and some gifts to cheer her out before we went out for a drink and some nibbles.
