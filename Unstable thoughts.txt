Working title: Unstable thoughts

Columns collapse
fall to the floor
Cruelty relapse
Internal war

Misery shared
Regrets mislaid
Hate unprepared
Love becomes frayed

Journey no more
Apart always
never foresore
life now ablaze

Reason/Description:
Was noticing a dependency on others happiness to feel happy. Like my happiness was blocked until everyone was happy. It 
made my come up with this prose quickly:

As one pillar falls, the rest fall with it
Sorrow comes in pairs
Feasting on each other's pain
Only down does the rabbit hole go

I decided to keep this poem to a small set of syllables with alternating rhymes. Make it feel abrupt and dislikable. Something that makes you detest it's existance as that are the feelings I detest.


Metres:
 - 4 syllable lines
 - End rhymes skip lines
