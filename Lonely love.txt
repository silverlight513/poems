Lonely love

Enveloped and surrounded by sky touch mountains
Consumed by calmness in these peaceful surroundings
Today in sunkissed hillsides, are moments rare
Solitude and intimacy, here we share
Present, here and now, often a dream long forgotten
Come and go are these moments, never that common
Paths and roads all unfamiliar have me lead astray
Unable to reach that desired place today
Consumed by calmness in these peaceful surroundings
Enveloped and surrounded by sky touch mountains

(Contrasting the beauty of nature and the feeling of being surrounded by love)

Couplet topics:
- The quiteness, the calm and comfort of your favorite people
- Maybe they don't come as often as you'd like
- Maybe they're hard to find
- Once you've found the right people, the calm comes
