Working title: Humming

1:
Hovering by petal close (Good but hard to rhyme)
With flutter wings mutter <Tie in rhyme with previous line. The two lines from the caesura don't need to rhyme>

2:
By sturdy wings frozen still
Slipping near, slurpping to fill

3:
Feathers of iridescence shine
Colors dripping columns wine

4:
Glisten do the petals
Of birds of burden settles

Reason/Description:
Based of an image I saw of a hummingbird that made me awe in how the colors flowed. 
I'm going to attempt to use Cynghanedd (most likely Draws) on every last line and try to keep to 
the rules of a Cywydd as much as possible.

Couplet topics:
Effortlessly floating in air
Wings flap fast enough to be invisible
Light hits them, the color flows
From one color to another, they glisten with light beaming
