Reason/Description:
Based of an image I saw of a hummingbird that made me awe in how the colors flowed. 
I'm going to attempt to use Cynghanedd (most likely Draws) on every last line and try to keep to 
the rules of a Cywydd as much as possible.

Couplet topics:
Effortlessly floating in air
Light hits them, the color gleams
Colors change from one to another
Wings flap fast enough to be invisible
