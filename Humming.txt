Working title: Humming

1:
Hovering by petal close (Good but hard to rhyme)
With flutter wings mutter <Tie in rhyme with previous line>

2:
With fluttered wings holding still
Slipping near, slurpping to fill <Don't like it but it's a cynhanedd>

3:
Feathers of iridescence shine
Colors dripping columns wine <Don't like it but it's a cynhanedd>

4:
Glisten do the petals
Of birds of burden settles <Don't like it but it's a Cynghanedd>

Reason/Description:
Based of an image I saw of a hummingbird that made me awe in how the colors flowed. 
I'm going to attempt to use Cynghanedd (most likely Draws) on every last line and try to keep to 
the rules of a Cywydd as much as possible.

Couplet topics:
Effortlessly floating in air
Wings flap fast enough to be invisible
Light hits them, the color flows
From one color to another, they glisten with light beaming
