Reason/Description
I was working on "Run", my 5th poem and I created this line that didn't quite fit but I liked it and wanted to evolve it. It's about how thinking of the end of your life as if it's now is such a horrible thing to go through.
 > Hate is that to have mind wonder to last
Since working on this as a villanelle, the "story" feels constricted by the use of refrains. So I'm going to take them away but keep to the original structure.

Metres:
4 stanzas
Start and end lines rhyme
All middle lines rhyme with each other
10 syllable lines
3 lines per stanza

Refrains:
Hate is that to have mind wonder to last
Misguided thoughts discards long life to fast

Tarcet topics:
How horrible life is to have these thoughts
What it does to you
When will it go away
Doomed to circle this soon to be grave forever
