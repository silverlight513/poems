To death

Hate is that to have mind wonder to last
Crippling life, too easy to throw away
For everything but want all willing care cast

As writhing agony causes endless tears
Hoping for this nightmare to cease today
Extinction of emotion over years

Life becomes numb when all you know is pain
Struggle is the slow wait till the new day
Hollow facades and fake smiles all in vein

Hoping for a time false promises become nonexistent
Sorrow, melancholy, wish to delay
Persistant pointless pain, mind feels vacant

Reason/Description
I was working on "Run", my 5th poem (removed after struggling to start) and I created this line that didn't quite fit but I liked it and wanted to evolve it. It's about how thinking of the end of your life as if it's now is such a horrible thing to go through.
 > Hate is that to have mind wonder to last
Since working on this as a villanelle, the "story" feels constricted by the use of refrains. So I'm going to take them away but keep to the original structure.
This feels like my weakest work yet. Trying to recollect memories from a banished time in my mind seems overly difficult to use as inspiration for writing. It's led to a somewhat stunted "story"
