Rheswm/disgrifiad:
Took out Nala (fy ci) in the middle of the night for a toilet break (she's a pup pup) and looked up at the stars and just thought about how beautiful they were and my mind just sort of wrote this exactly as it is now in that moment. My partner, when I explained the meaning behind it said it was way more beautiful in english but to me Welsh is so beautiful and pure, it had to be in Welsh.
