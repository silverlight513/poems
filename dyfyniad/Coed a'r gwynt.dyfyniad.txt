Reason/Description:
I've always wanted to write poetry in Welsh but I'm yet to speak it well enough. I can however string some sentences together to form a snippet. I was thinking about how poetry is written in Welsh and how I find it to be more simple and less flamboyant than what I'd write in Welsh. This may be because I don't understand the connotations of words or even just enough words. So I thought, what is simple, yet meaningful. Common and misunderstood. At the moment, I'm writing Mind in the mountains which focuses on using juxtaposition and so this snippet is, to me, about how two things seen as opposing can come together to create something beautiful.

Translation:
The harmony between the trees and the wind, rustling gently
