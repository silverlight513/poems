Reason/Description:
Poetry in the Arcades competition run with FOR cardiff. https://mightyatom.net/poetryinthearcades
Grey skies, hidden alleyways, gloomy days. Run from the rain and hide away.
When the sun comes and the people come out to play

Second option Description:
Non-Welshmen Tend to see Cardiff as a pointless city, nothing of real consequence. It's just like everywhere else. But when they give it a chance they see the hidden beauties tucked away. The overshadowing monuments holding so much history and so much pride and passion. They see the kindness and love exuding from a deep, rich culture grown since the beginning of Britain, handed down from generation to generation. Eventually, people who stay long enough grow to call this place home but can never put their finger on why they love it here so much. Some think it's the people, some think it's the culture and for some it's the beauty but for me, it's just that comfort of belonging.

Couplet topics:
Places to hide and run in the bad weather
Stadiums quiet and no one seen
Intricate avenues to get lost
When the skies make way for the sun
People come out and torches lit
Bustling streets and packed crowds
