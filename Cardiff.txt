Working title: The two sides of Cardiff

1.1.
Cloudy skies, unknown alleyways
Running from rain on gloomy days

1.2.
Streets and stadiums so hollow
Silence falls, people hidden stow

1.3.
Intricate mazes secluded
Uncharted avenues shrouded

<1.2 & 1.3 halt the flow of the poem>

2.1.
When skies clear and murky clouds fade
Beams come shining through all rayed

2.2.
Singers, poets and performers
Brilliance blossoms <in a world of heart and passion>

2.3.

Reason/Description:
Poetry in the Arcades competition run with FOR cardiff. https://mightyatom.net/poetryinthearcades
Prose for initial idea:
  Grey skies, hidden alleyways, gloomy days. Run from the rain and hide away. When the sun comes and the people come out to play
When writing, I'm starting to struggle with the two sides of Cardiff idea. It works well in my head and possible in prose but with metres, it's difficult to express. I think I was missing passion and the expression of that passion and welsh pride. With pride and passion, everything is better!

Metres:
 - 8 syllable lines
 - Couplets with end rhymes
 - 3 couplets per verse
 - 2 verses

Couplet topics:
Places to hide and run in the bad weather
Stadiums quiet and no one seen
Intricate avenues to get lost
When the skies make way for the sun
People come out and torches lit
Bustling streets and packed crowds
