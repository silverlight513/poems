A vibrant rainbow juxtaposed to the sky
still shines on the darkest of days.

Reason/Description:
I was travelling into work (my first tech dept. day since before lockdown (March 2020)). Along the 5 mile lane, I saw a rainbow out in front of a wall of black clouds. The sun was shining behind me causing the rainbow but it was a stunning view. Also, in case any english lit student or teacher sees this and thinks it has a hidden meaning, it does not. It was a rainbow on a cool backdrop. Everyone hates "read between the lines".
