Reason/Description:
Thinking about insta-poetry and how people always want something that is simple yet powerful and easy to understand. I thought, well, the internet is full of mis-communication. It's common for people to misunderstand when they're not talking in person. What if I made a snippet based off the flaws and wants of the internet. Black star refers to David Bowie's last album and single, which in my opinion is some of his best work but most critics/listeners prefer the classics. Those classics being his breadth of success in the music industry. To me, this snippet signifies that you can have something amazing even if others are disappointed by it, something you can be proud of even if it has no love from others. Now, I assume most people who read this will read it for face value as an ugly duckling story or the one failure with success to follow.
