Recognition

See yourself
You are a sea of light
An ocean of opportunity
Be ferocious and kind

Reason/Description:
This one was left for a while, (why start and end date are so far apart). I remember thinking about all the lack of motivation people have and how they never see themselves as a person who can do things or be things. Everyone looks up to people and wants to become them, they never recognize they could be the person someone else wants to become. Reflect, notice, be kind and fight for what you want to be.

I started this off with the below thought.
"You are a sea of light, open your eyes. See yourself."
