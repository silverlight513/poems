Reason/Description
I had a moment when this was true. Reflecting on that moment a few days later I had this prose pop into my head:
  Run, run after what you love. Love may be heartbreak when you get there but run, run after what you want, what you need. Raw and passionate love. 
It's about that scared moment when you're not sure a loved one will still be home when you get there and you're chasing after them to save them and save your heart.
Considering the prose, I'm tempted to write this using similar metres to Dylan Thomas' Do not go gentle into that good night (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanelle#Form)

Metres:
four stanzas of three lines followed by a last stanza of 4 lines.
Every middle line must rhyme with themselves.
Alternate refrains from stanza to stanza and use both refrains on the last stanza
