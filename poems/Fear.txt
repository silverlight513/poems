Fear

What wretched feeling fear is
A great delusion clinging closely to the heart
Such enduring persistent affliction is this
The tortuous counterpart

Harrowed life to no retire
Worries fill the mind with no room for joyous hope
Fighting fierce throughout the day with gut wrenching fire
Feeling unable to cope

Under shallow smiles we hide
Never do we let others know that pain we bear
Masquerading to all, concealing what's inside
This life is solemnly fair

Reason/Description:
Woke up feeling scared and stressed and it made me think of how horrible this feeling is.
I ended up getting this prose in my head about the whole ordeal:
  What wretched feeling is fear
  A delusion clinging close to your heart
  Beating faster and harder
  Unbeknowing to you
  What is it, this fear
