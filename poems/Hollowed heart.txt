Hollowed heart

I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for that text.
An affirmation of reciprocation.
A craving of longing desire,
that I so selfishly require.

The end of day drives closer
And hopes gap becomes that bit shorter.
My mind wanders to unfaithful thoughts.
Years of trust deconstructs
when loves poison thorn cuts.

Did I place too much trust in them?
So much misguided love and devotion?
Perhaps.
But blind leaps must be made
or life's regrets are sown and laid.

A caring friendship that slowly drifts.
A growing chasm achingly rifts.
Hollowed out,
This pain I try to discard
already has my heart scarred.

And now I'm drowning in a sea of loneliness.
Forever beholden to past bias.
The struggle to let go
becomes all too real.
I no longer know what to feel.
