Writers block

What do I write about?
the mundane, the average.
The things that pass us by every day

We never give them
a passing thought.
We never look up

Must we only seek out
the thirlling, the exciting
and discard the rest?

Can there be no beauty
in the simple?
Or no excitement in the boring.

Soon, we'll be left
with a world where
the extraordinary becomes the ordinary.

Reason/Description:
I've been reading a lot of poetry books recently and wanted to write something but I can't think of a topic I'd like to write about, so, I'll write about not knowing what topic to write.
