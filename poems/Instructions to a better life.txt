Instructions to a better life

Take a break!
This world is too fast,
too hectic and dramatic.

Go sit down and listen,
to the space you occupy.
To the life you live.

Take that moment,
to stop and reject the world
that we all succumb to.

Enjoy a moment of peace.
A peace we must take
any time we can.

Glance out that window
and watch the trees blow
and watch the suns rays glow.

Breathe.

Reason/Description:
I was sitting in my office (at home) and put on my new record (I'm making friends with the silence by K.Flay). The backside of the record is a narration of the EP's creation. Since it's vinyl, it isn't as easily paused so I sat there, itchy that I cannot do anything but sit and listen. Eventually, as it continued, I looked out the window and became overwhelmed with brief calmness. I wanted to write some instructions, to myself and anyone that'll listen, to help reach that calmness that's so often forgotten is accessible.
