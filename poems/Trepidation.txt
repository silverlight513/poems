Trepidation

In life we topple and tumble through
A path unbeknownst to most, we slew
Decisions to devote or debate
Is each journeys bifurcation fate?
Choices arrive too great to forsake
Trying to peer at options wake
Guidance distorted by random chance
Thrown into each violent advance
Tread gently through this wondrous minefield
Passage ahead is all but revealed

Reason/Description:
After being made redundant from my job during the 2020 pandemic, I wondered; what do the choices I make actually mean. A topic I've always wondered is how people choose between choices that'll make them happy vs successful. As my mind does often, a sprig of sentences:
  Tumbling through the story
  The path hidden to me
  Distorted by random chances
  Random action, random people
  Does a path even exist
  And where does it lead
