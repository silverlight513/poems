The abrupt ending

Trapped on a delicate vine, 
Taught as tracking twine.
A spring loaded tragedy.

A Scottish play of fewer actors.
Lethality at their lips.
Wicked intent omitted.

A life laid down bare.
My mind, my heart, ready to tear.
Shattered pieces abound.

So I stand and stand again,
alone in twisted fate.
Succumb to painfall melancholy.

A crescendo of explosive might,
Pushing me into a solitary fight.
Through many days and nights.

But life continues,
in it's cruelest forms.
As I bob along the waves.

Taken adrift through this gloomy act.
Of Satan's playwright's pact.
This ragdoll prop strung and strewn.

Soon, I hope the calm arrives.
The peaceful shallow waters.
Let me wade to shore

And I finally say goodbye,
To this chapter gone awry.
A wholly cured end.

Reason/Description:
After over a year at therapy, learning how to deal with my life and my problems, mostly onset from ADHD and autism. The last session with my therapist was booked, after a couple delays and rearrangements. When I arrived, my therapist was no where to be found. Office closed, no texts, no calls. To this day, I have not heard, nor saw him. I don't know what happened but I've had to learn to cope with the loss of that relationship and the safetynet it provided me. I wrote this as a way to figure out my feelings and thoughts at the time.

Metres:
Every other stanza's first two lines must rhyme.
