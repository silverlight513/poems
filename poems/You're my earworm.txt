You're my earworm

You keep stumbling
back into my mind like
you're my new earworm.

Taking up so
much space in
my concious.

And every so often
you send me voice notes
as you walk home.

And I get so lost.
What do I say,
what do I do?

Eventually,
I muster the knowledge
to respond with rambling words.

Did I say enough?
Did I make things better
or have I made them worse?

I hope I've helped.
