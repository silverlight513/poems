Sweet liars

Silver sworded tongues
forge feign tales so fatal
from their mad minded craze.

A skilled negotiation
drawing the line of what's palatable
into practical parlays.

But those sweet liars get caught
tripping a tongue tumble
of wordsmith plays.

Truth tellers interrogate
and their shallow walls crumble.
Under naked fires they set ablaze.
