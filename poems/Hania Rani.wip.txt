Working title: Hania Rani

A pianist,
a contortionist
of sound.

Pouring their emotions
into notes on a page
for us to hear.

--

Emotions that sometimes
come from nowhere
in particular.

But this pianist
played to us her
greek tragedy.

--

She cowered as she plays
such solemn notes
from her haunted past.

Vibrating throughout
the auditorium.
Where her notes cast.   (This needs to be less janky)

--

A sadness fills the air
where the people
stand and listen.

Trying to grasp
the complexities
of her emotions.

--

Someone else's world.
A world they
can't possibly imagine.

Somewhere isolated
And alone.
A self inflected burden.

--

But when all falls silent.
A moment is caught.
The wait of approval.

Then a thunderous
applause falls
towards the stage.

--

Even though she
showed such sadness,
the people applaud.

A harrowed art
returns great affection.
...

--

And such a gleeful
smile befalls the pianist.

Reason/Description:
My friend took my partner and I to a gig in bristol. It was of a pianist, Hania Rani. While in the crowd I watched and listened to her art as well as how people perceived it. The style of music was amazing and I wrote this while I was in the crowd.
