Working title: Hania Rani

A pianist,
a contortionist
of sound.

--

Pouring out
their soul
without fear.

Putting it
all out there
for us to hear.

--

For us she
chose to play
her greek tragedy.

And as she played.
We hoped we
could be her remedy.

--

She cowered as she went.
The notes so solemn.
All coming from a haunted past.

A past of despair.
One we hoped
wouldn't last.

--

Her pain filled the air.
The somber history of
her creations.

Trying to grasp
the complexities
of her emotions.

--

It was someone else's world.
A place we
can't possibly imagine.

Somewhere so isolated
and alone, where their
mind becomes a weapon.

--

Fighting against
themselves
for such a long time.

Without help they
whithered.
Taken from their prime.

--

But when all falls silent.
A moment is caught and
they wait for approval.

Holding their breathe
for the applause
that befalls crucible.

--

Happy to have
shared her world
and her burden.

She sits,
warn out and tired
but no longer broken.

Reason/Description:
My friend took my partner and I to a gig in bristol. It was of a pianist, Hania Rani. While in the crowd I watched and listened to her art as well as how people perceived it. The style of music was amazing and I wrote this while I was in the crowd.
