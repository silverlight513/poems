Working title: Hania Rani

A pianist,
a contortionist
of sound.

--

Pouring out
their soul
without fear.

Putting it
all out there
for us to hear.

--

Emotions dripping
through every
note so steady.

This pianist
chose to play us
their greek tragedy.

--

She cowered as she played.
The notes so solemn.
Drawn from her haunted past.

Each key vibrating
throughout the auditorium.
Sadness so vast.

--

It filled the air.
The history of
their creations.

Trying to grasp
the complexities
of their emotions.

--

It's someone else's world.
A world they
can't possibly imagine.

Somewhere isolated
And alone.
A self inflected burden.

--

But when all falls silent.
This moment is caught.
They wait of approval.

Holding their breathe
for that applause
inside this crucible.
--

And such a gleeful
smile befalls the pianist.
Happy to have shared her world.

Reason/Description:
My friend took my partner and I to a gig in bristol. It was of a pianist, Hania Rani. While in the crowd I watched and listened to her art as well as how people perceived it. The style of music was amazing and I wrote this while I was in the crowd.
