Working title: I have no use for flowers

1.
Don't give me flowers, 
Let them live.
I have no use for living things.
I cannot see rainbows of color
I cannot smell fruity flavors

Reason/Description:
On a long weekend I had a day to myself and I wasn't feeling great so I figured I'd walk the dog for a bit of a long walk, roughly 6 miles. Since the village I live in isn't the best for connections via walking (mostly country lanes), there's only two safe routes to do a long walk. One ended with ice cream and a pup cup so obviously that's the first choice. On the way there happens to be the church at which my family and most notably for me, my nan is burried. While I was waking through the graveyard I pondered on the thought and futility of laying flowers for the dead and out grew this poem.
