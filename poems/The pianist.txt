The pianist

A pianist,
a contortionist
of sound.

Pouring out
their soul
without fear.

Putting it
all out there
for us to hear.

For us,
she played
her greek tragedy.

And as she played.
We hoped we
could be her remedy.

She cowered as she went.
The notes so solemn.
All coming from a haunted past.

A past of despair.
One we hoped
wouldn't last.

Her pain filled the air.
A somber history in
her creations.

Trying to convey
the complexities
of her emotions.

But It was someone else's
world. A place we
can't possibly imagine.

Somewhere so isolated
and alone, where their
mind becomes a weapon.

Fighting against
themselves
for such a long time.

Without help
they whither.
Taken from their prime.

But when all falls silent.
A moment is caught and
they wait for approval.

Holding their breathe
for the applause
that befalls this crucible.

She sits,
warn out and tired
but no longer broken.

Happy to have
shared her world
and her burden.

Reason/Description:
My friend took my partner and I to a gig in bristol. It was of the pianist, Hania Rani. While in the crowd I watched and listened to her art as well as watching how people perceived it. The style of music was amazing and I started to write this while I was in the crowd.
