Working title: Misplaced life

Hollow here I am
Lost to everything held dear
Blind to aid
Running in circles forevermore
Pain and anguish hand in hand
Tortured by my kin
Pushed to the brink
But let go, not yet
An end I plead

I ask, if only I chose a different path
A kinder way, a forgiving way
Would I still be lost
Would I still be hollow
Bring me back
An end I plead

Found an old prose in my notes about how it feels to go through depression. Most likely arose from having a depressive episode. Worked on it a little now that I'm looking at more freeform work.
