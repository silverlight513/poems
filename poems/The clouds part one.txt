The clouds part one

On a sweet spring morning
burried under a mountain of sheets.
I finally get the time 
to read my literary treats.

And I'm all cozied up
behind the dewy windows.
The sun shines through
lighting the room in golden glows.

As the pages get turned,
the sun shies away
hiding behind clouds
as if I've scared it away

I apologise and hope
That it'll come to greet me again
And share it's warmth with me
So I can enjoy a moment again.

Reason/Description:
I had been having a couple difficult weeks. Lots of ups and downs dealing with emotional dysregulation. I'd been trying a few different methods of action within these weeks with varying success. For this week my method included reading, something I very rarely do and after around 30 minutes of reading, I wrote down the first draft of this. I liked the allegory between my mental state and the clouds, causing problems for the sun (my happiness).

Metres:
- 4 line stanzas 
- 2nd and 4th must rhyme
