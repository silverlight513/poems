Silent sadness

Stone tounged
Heavy hearted
Love departed

Pain grows
to sorrowed eve's 
and blistered morrow's

My face a pane
still and shattered
pours like rain

While fear encroaches
My walls falling
And dread approaches

Sitting hunched
Face in palms
Nothing to confront

Empty hollowed
Cut and carved
On time borrowed

Reason/Description:
My wife and I went to see a show (Christmas Carol Goes Wrong) and I was constantly disturbed by the ill mannered attendees seated behind us. This put me on a knife edge of sourness and later led to a disagreement between us that upset us to the point at which we drove home in silence. It wasn't a bad argument by any stretch, simply one that triggered worrying thoughts
