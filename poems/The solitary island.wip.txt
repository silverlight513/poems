Working title: The solitary island

1.
On a turbulent winters day
Sunken tides reveal a new path
To a solitary island kept at shores reach
Forward unto treacherous wrath
A journey of entangled wonder beset each

2.
Stepping on algae tangled rock
Into the bwlch of wild bramble
Almost near forgotten trails now to be re-penned
Here a thorn and thistle ramble
Enveloped between grassy hilltops at cliffs end

Reason/Description:
I visited Sully island and the place mesmerized me. All the different elements playing together put me at awe.
I quickly wrote this prose to remember:
  On a stormy day and far away tide
  Grassy hilltops sit on this Rocky Peninsula
  Waves crash against such lonesome rock
  Extreme gales pull down any erect
  It's Frontline battered and broken
  Boulders fall into oceans abyss
