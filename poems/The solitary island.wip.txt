Working title: The solitary island

1.
On a turbulent winters day
Sunken tides reveal a new path
To a solitary island kept at shores reach
Forward unto treacherous wrath
A journey of entangled wonder beset each

2.
Stepping on algae tangled rock
Into the bwlch of wild bramble
Almost near forgotten trails now to be re-penned
Here a thorn and thistle ramble
Enveloped between grassy hilltops at cliffs end

3.
Paths precipice a graveyard
Slain protectors from ocean waves
Once bound together with unyielding shielding might
Cruelly culling each to their graves
Now a new fresh face ready to take up the fight

4.
Deviate from trails onto shores
Where craggy tidal levels lay
Tumultuous blasts of unstoppable tempest
Pull overtop these rough gales slay
Life abandoned battlegrounds became encompassed

Reason/Description:
I visited Sully island and the place mesmerized me. All the different elements playing together put me at awe.
I quickly wrote this prose to remember:
  On a stormy day and far away tide
  Grassy hilltops sit on this Rocky Peninsula
  Waves crash against such lonesome rock
  Extreme gales pull down any erect
  It's Frontline battered and broken
  Boulders fall into oceans abyss
This poem's style is inspired but in now way matches "The wreck of the Deutschland" by Gerard Manley Hopkins
