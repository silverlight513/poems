Working title: Self defence

1.
Sinking into a self laden melancholy
Of woeful willingness // a willing wallowing
A defence for taunting triggers

Reason/Description:
While driving to pick up Nala (my dog) from her weekly day training session, I became mildly infuriated, as I often do, with the poor standard people have managed to muster for their driving ability. This has often been a pain point for me that's come up in therapy a few times. Managing my emotions are something I always have to work on and to distract myself from the abilities of others I started writing this in my head and decided to see where it goes.
