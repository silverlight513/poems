By marched boot

Not by marched boot
nor standard borne.
They came parading through the streets.

Where businessmen on podiums
sing corrupted psalms
to gullible crowds.

Swallowing every word
these unknowingly uneducated, 
gag, on their knees

And so the downfall of society lay.
Turning a blind eye to reason
and holding it's breathe.

Reason/Description:
On the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration, political games are being played in front of the whole world. Last time Trump was president, the hitler playbook was played. Since then I had hoped playground fascism has subsided but it appears as though we're in for a reinforced encore. 

I let this sit for a day to recoup my thoughts and as if by magical alignment of the stars, my fears of rising fascism grow as Elon Musk throws out two distinct Sieg Heil's at a presedential inauguration as if USA is now at war with its own blood.

The next day after this Meta had hidden searches containing posts for any center/left wing content claiming it was too "sensitive" to be shown.

ETA: Since I started writing this, the political landscape has gotten worse so instead of continuing to write and work this, I am leaving the original first 4 stanzas to reflect the time I saw. Now, More high ranked officials in the US are throwing Nazi Salutes. Trump has aligned himself with Russia and fights his countries allies. Luckily, Europe holds fast and we hopefully can withstand these next four years without Ukraine falling, Russia invading and USA collapsing. Pob lwc pawb.
