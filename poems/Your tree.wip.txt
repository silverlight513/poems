Blowing blue leaves linger in the wind
Dragging branches like sails
Under a blistering sun.

Reason/Description:
I'd recently learnt that in welsh, there never used to be a word for green. Back before green was added, people would describe "greenery" as blue. Something luscious as blue. In this vein, I figured I'd try to come up with a line to use it as it would have done originally. This grew into an idea about a poem about a tree and I figured it could be a good exercise to write about something so generically that people could envisage their own tree from their own memories through what I've written. Hope it works.
