Working title: Sweet liars

1.
Silver sworded tongues
roll an opportunistic fable.
Forming an intricate maze.

2.
It's a finessed negotiation
drawing the line of what's palatable
into particular parlays.

3.
But those sweet liars get caught
in self laden honey traps  // this doesn't rhyme
of wordsmith plays.

4.
Truth tellers stoke
Their shallow walls crumble
under naked fires blaze
