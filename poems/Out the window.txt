Out the window

Scarcity of friends and contented fun
Created cause for substitute delight
Consider the glowing touch from the sun
Falling leaves blowing fitfully in flight
Daffodils flourish blazen and golden
Hovering seagulls lifeless as a kite
Out of your window holds beauty to none
Isolation does need to be a fright

Reason/Description:
When life is scarce of friends and people you have to start looking for more than fellow humans. In a time of solace, you need to get off your glass pedestal of friendship and embrace the loneliness of the world and what it can be. Start noticing the way the sun touches your face when you look out your window. Or the way the leaves blow down the street by an invisible force. Daffodils growing in formation along the hedgerows. The seagulls hovering still over buildings.

When stuck in a countrywide lockdown from covid-19 (day 16). You have to stay sane and what better way to do that than to take in what nature you can. I've been seeing a few quotes around that helped me realize this. To make this true to me and not just some generic happy piece I'm going to focus on what I can see out of my window in my flat on Lloyd George Ave.
