Someone else's eyes

Do you ever wonder?
What's it like,
to look in the mirror
and see through
someone else's eyes?

To find all your
imperfections gone.
Replaced by new marks,
new folds and colors.
To not be you.

Nothing feels 
out of place.
Yet everything
has changed.
Not for better or worse.

But all that effort
that went into
how you look.
Gone, in a puff of smoke.
And what was it for?

Those sacrafices you made.
The pain you went through.
The long game you played,
to lose those few inches
around the waist.

And what was it for?
You can still breathe.
You can still walk.
You can run and run
till your lungs give out.

You're still human.
A working, loving human.

Reason/Description:
Just thinking about life while I was in the shower and how lots of humans these days tend to have some form of body dismorphia or a bad relationship with how they look. These thoughts are how I calm myself down and move myself away from the bad thoughts about how I look.
