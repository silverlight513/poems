You ignore me

Cast aside
pushed away
trodden over
and cut for good measure.
Laying breathless
motionless
helpless.
And you ignore me.

It's ten to midnight
and I'm crying
through the pain.
Driving down the highway
with no aim or direction.
A distraction
so I feel a little less.
And you still ignore me.

A week ago
I was happy.
I had love.
It showed me
what could be.
But now
I have solitude
and you still ignore me

Reason/Description:
I had an horric night that went on longer than it should. My emotions were unstable and conflicted. The disabilities took a hold of me and I was lost. Things worked out in the end but it was difficult.
I sort of just wrote this as I was feeling. The pain went straight to words so I could sort of express and remember what I felt. I touched it up the next day so that it made more sense outside of the moment.
