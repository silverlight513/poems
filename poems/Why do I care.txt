Working title: Why do I care

1.
Do I care too much about offending?
Hurting people I've never met.
People who I have no desire to befriend.

2.
The world is a hateful place
and I wish to avoid it all.
I want to move to a place
that is kind, but this earth isn't that.

3.
I need to learn to be better.
Not to push myself to an extreme
but to be kinder to myself.
To not care about those people.
So that I can live my life,
happily.
