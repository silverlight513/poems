I lay

I lay in silence
Not because I'm tired
Or too weak to move

I lay here crying
Because I'm alone
With nothing to prove

Alone with no purpose
No reason to move
I've become unbalanced

And now not even the noises
Disturb me anymore
My world's become silenced

And the screens don't move
They stand still like time
Taking a painful nosedive

I lay here waiting
For life to unpause
And normality to arrive

Reason/Description:
My partner had recently changed career and was out on a work trip to web summit 2023. This was the first time she had been away for longer than a couple days since we started living together, roughly 5 years prior. I thought I'd be enjoying my free time, doing what I want without compromise but instead, I was shocked to find that I grew lonely and missed her.
