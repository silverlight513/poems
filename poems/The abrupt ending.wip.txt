Working title: The abrupt ending

1.
Trapped on a delicate vine, 
Taught as tracking twine.
A spring loaded tragedy.

2.
A Scottish play of fewer
Actors yet just as deadly, 
Albeit deficient in wicked intent. 

3.
Our life laid down bare.
My mind, my heart, ready to tear
Into shattered pieces. 

4.
So I stand and stand again,
alone in twisted fate.
Succumb to painfall melancholy.

5.
A crescendo of explosive might,
Pushing me into a solitary fight.
Through many days and nights.

6.
But life continues,
in it's cruelest forms.
As I bob along the waves.

7.
Taken adrift through this gloomy act.
Satan's playwright's pact.
This ragdoll prop strung and strewn.

8.

Reason/Description:
After over a year at therapy, learning how to deal with my life and my problems, mostly onset from my ADHD and autism. The last session with my therapist was set, after a couple delays. When I arrived, my therapist was no where to be found. To this day, I have not heard, nor saw him. I don't know what happened but I've had to learn to cope with the loss of that relationship. I wrote this as a way to figure out my feelings and thoughts at the time.

Metres:
Every other stanza's first two lines must rhyme.
