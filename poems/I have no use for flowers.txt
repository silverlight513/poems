I have no use for flowers

I have no use for flowers or living things.
They'd be wasted on me.
So please...

Don't dig them up
Or pull them out.
Just let them be.

As I can't smell 
their sweet nectar 
or perfumy aromas.

I can't admire
their dramatic colors
or delicate leaves.

All I can do is lay here 
and be a memory to those
that still need those living things.

Reason/Description:
On a long weekend I had a day to myself and I wasn't feeling great so I figured I'd walk the dog for a bit of a long walk, roughly 6 miles. Since the village I live in isn't the best for connections via walking (mostly country lanes), there's only two safe routes to do a long walk. One ended with ice cream and a pup cup so obviously that's the first choice. On the way there happens to be the church at which my family and most notably for me, my nan is burried. While I was waking through the graveyard I pondered on the thought and futility of laying flowers for the dead and out grew this poem.
