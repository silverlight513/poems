Lonely love

Enveloped and surrounded by sky touch mountains
Consumed by calmness in these peaceful surroundings
When in sunkissed hillsides, are moments rare
Solitude and intimacy, here we share
Present, here and now, often a dream long forgotten
Come and go through these times, never that common
Unfamiliar are the trails that lead me astray
Unable to reach that desired peak today
Consumed by calmness in these peaceful surroundings
Enveloped and surrounded by sky touch mountains

Reason/Description:
The feeling of being surrounded by loved ones, be that a partner or friends.
Taking that single moment when you realize you're so happy and calm being amongst
them. Not in enjoyment but in satisfaction. A similar feeling to when I'm in the
mountains looking out at the view and enjoying where I am. Contrasting the beauty
of nature and the feeling of being surrounded by love.

Writing inspired by the Windhover by Gerard Manley Hopkins and his use of traditional
Welsh poetry metres. It was written as an attempt at writing an Awdl.

Couplet topics:
- The quiteness, the calm and comfort of your favourite people
- Maybe they don't come as often as you'd like
- Maybe they're hard to find
- Once you've found the right people, the calm comes
