Working title: The clouds part one

1.
A couple weeks have gone by
and the turmoil in my mind
has done nothing but amplify.

2.
I yearn for that day,
where all seemed hopefull.
Wishing time away, as they say.

3.
With everyone around me
somehow, someway
holding up their worlds so easily.

4. // This needs work. Line 1 is good but the others are clunky
And I'm down here
struggling continously
amidst all the fear.

5.
Maybe they struggle too
and they're all lying.

6.
One day things will change

Reason/Description:
A couple weeks on from starting to write the first poem. I found myself in more trouble of my own brains doing. I wanted to continue writing within the same poem but it felt like there should be a break to account for the time that's passed.
