Humming birds in flight

Hovering by petal close
wings swoop and wind swiftly flows
By sturdy wings frozen still
Slipping near, slurping to fill
Feathers of iridescence shine
Colours dripping columns wine
Glisten do the petals
Of birds of burden settles

Reason/Description:
Based of an image I saw of a hummingbird that made me awe in how the colours flowed.
I'm going to attempt to use Cynghanedd (most likely Draws) on every last line and try to keep to
the rules of a Cywydd as much as possible.

Couplet topics:
Effortlessly floating in air
Wings flap fast enough to be invisible
Light hits them, the colour flows
From one colour to another, they glisten with light beaming
