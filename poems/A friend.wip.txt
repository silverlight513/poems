Working title:

Next to me, perched you sit,
overlooking the city,
everything that encompases who we are.
This is our little escape from the world.
A world that erodes and consumes us.

We talk of todays troubling thoughts.
The words that solemly leave lips so easily
But love and care exhales from your heart
and fills mine with comfort and warmth.

Hours pass
and the sun dips.
Gold pours over the sky
as if fallen from a painters pallete.
A sign,
that this soliloquy for two is at its end.

Reason/Description:
During lockdon 3.0 I was remembering the time just after the first lockdown when Rachel and I would go for walks to this bench upon the hill in Penarth where you could see all of Cardiff and we just talked about whatever and we helped each other be a little bit happier.

Original prose:
"
Looking out over cardiff
A comfortable companion
One to talk the day away
Till the sun sets behind us
