Working title:

You sit next to me perched,
overlooking the city,
everything that encompases who we are.
This is our tiny escape from the world.
The world that erodes and subdues us.

We talk of todays troubling thoughts.
The words that solemly leave lips so easily
But love and care exhales from your heart
and fills mine with comfort and warmth.
