Reason/Description:
I visited Sully island and the place mesmerized me. All the different elements playing together put me at awe.
I quickly wrote this prose to remember:
  On a stormy day and far away tide
  Grassy hilltops sit on this Rocky Penninsula
  Waves crash against such lonesome rock
  Extreme gales pull down any erect
  It's Frontline battered and broken
  Boulders fall into oceans abyss
