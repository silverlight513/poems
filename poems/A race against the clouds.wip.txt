Working title: A race against the clouds

1.
Sometimes, when I drive my car
I race the clouds
To avoid the rain

2.
Their darkness creeping
slowly towards me,
hanging in my rear view mirror.

3.
Their unescapable presence 
and uncontrollable actions
dictate my path.

4.

Reason/Description:
I was driving to see a friend a while back and the concept of racing the clouds came into my mind as I drove along the road. I kept going in and out of the border of their rainfall. It struck a chord with me and stayed in my head for a long time. Eventually, I sat down and wrote this.
