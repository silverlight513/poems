Working title: The red castle

Buried amidst soaring trees
Stone and timber fantasies
Home to stories of long ago
Feudal fairy tales aglow
Here history relinquished
The weight of time abraded
Let this grand fortress endure
Now golden ceilings allure
Tinted rose stone resolute
Crenelations involute
Hidden mystical nature
In this castle of amber

Reason/Description:
I want to do a more in detail descriptive piece. I enjoyed writing about the humming bird photo so I thought, let's do another. This time, about a photo I've taken in a place I enjoy. https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj1jtJHlFru/. This place is often referred to as a fairy tale caslte since it was rebuilt to be a second home for the 3rd Marquess of Bute in the 19th century.
