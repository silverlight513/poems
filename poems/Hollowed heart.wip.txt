Working title: Hollowed heart

1.
I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for that text.
The affirmation of reciprocation.
It's arrival would be my saviour.
For without, I cannot face her.

2.
The clocks strike past every hour
and the close of day comes ever closer.
My phone's still empty
and the sour realisation
adds to the growing tension.

3.
Did I place too much trust in them?
Misguided love and devotion? // Devotion???
Perhaps.
Like a long burning candle,
only the wick left to gamble. // Why gamble?

4.
The pain I try to discard
has already scarred my heart.

// Can't work out these last lines. Is rampart even a good direction? Take it back to the topic?
Solitude
and I become clad in armour.
I am no longer a lover.
