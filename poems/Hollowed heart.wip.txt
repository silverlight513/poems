Working title: Hollowed heart

1.
I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for the text.
The affirmation of reciprocation.
A craving of longing desire,
that I so desperately require.

2.
The hand strikes past every hour, // This doesn't flow from the previous stanza
and the end of day comes ever closer.
My phone's still empty
and the sour realisation approaches.
Loves firm hold detaches.

3.
Did I place too much trust in them?
So much misguided love and devotion?
Perhaps.
But blind leaps must be made
or life's regret becomes due paid.

4.

--
Hollowed.
The pain I try to discard
has already scarred my heart.

5.
Drowning in a sea of loneliness.
