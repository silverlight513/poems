Working title: Hollowed heart

1.
I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for a text.
Will it appear?
I doubt and waver,
fearing it'll never be here.

2.
The clocks strike every hour
and the close of day comes ever closer.
My phone still empty.

3.
Did I place too much trust in them?
Misguided love and devotion.
Perhaps.

4.
I build up my ramparts
saving myself from hollowed hearts // reword???
