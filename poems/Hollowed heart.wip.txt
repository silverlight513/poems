Working title: Hollowed heart

1.
I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for the text.
An affirmation of reciprocation.
A craving of longing desire,
that I so desperately require.

2.
The end of day drives closer.
The hands clock past every hour.
Barren is my social crop
and the sour realisation approaches.
Loves firm hold detaches.

3.
Did I place too much trust in them?
So much misguided love and devotion?
Perhaps.
But blind leaps must be made
or life's regrets are sown and laid.

4.
A caring friendship that slowly drifts.
A growing chasm slowly rifts.
Hollowed.
This pain I try to discard
has already scarred my heart.

5.
And now I'm drowning in a sea of loneliness.
Forever beholden to past conscious.
