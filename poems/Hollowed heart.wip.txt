Working title: Hollowed heart

1.
I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for the text.
An affirmation of reciprocation.
A craving of longing desire,
that I so desperately require.

2.
The end of day drives closer.
The hands clock past every hour.
-- // Use a metaphore about how the phone hasn't
and the sour realisation approaches.
Loves firm hold detaches.

3.
Did I place too much trust in them?
So much misguided love and devotion?
Perhaps.
But blind leaps must be made
or life's regrets are sown and laid.

4.
Carving friendship slowly drifts
and my heart becomes carved instead. // This is utter crap
Hollowed.
The pain I try to discard
has already scarred my heart.

5.
Drowning in a sea of loneliness.
