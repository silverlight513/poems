Working title: Hollowed heart

1.
I wait, drawing breath.
Longing for that text.
The affirmation of reciprocation.
A craving of longing desire,
that I so desperately require.

2.
The hands strike past every hour,
as the close of day comes ever closer.
My phone's still empty
and the sour realisation approaches.
Slowly thoughts of disappointment encroaches. // This doesn't work

3.
Did I place too much trust in them?
So much misguided love and devotion?
Perhaps. // This doesn't work anymore

4.
The pain I try to discard
has already scarred my heart.
Hollowed.

Drowned in loneliness
