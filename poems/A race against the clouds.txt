A race against the clouds

Sometimes, when I drive my car
I race against the clouds
To avoid the rain.

When I look in the rear view mirror.
I can see those dark clouds
come rolling in.

That sheet of rain 
standing like a wall,
creeping ever closer.

Through these windy roads,
turning left, then right.
The road dictates my path.

In and out I swerve,
in and out from each other.
These grazing shots soon become a barrage.

Mile after mile,
we collide and fight.
I'm struggling to pull away.

I'm on a collision course,
On an unmovable track
where the clouds overlap.

Eventually, I'm fully enveloped.
I can't see anything
but the downpour.

So I continue to drive
along this long windy road.
Until I reach my destination.

Hoping at some point,
the rain will fade away.
So I can drive freely.

Reason/Description:
I was driving to see a friend a while back and the concept of racing the clouds came into my mind as I drove along the road. I kept going in and out of the border of their rainfall. It struck a chord with me and stayed in my head for a long time. Eventually, I sat down and wrote this.

I wanted this to be a reflection in part of running away from your demons and also how the weather can affect your mood
