The clouds part two

A couple weeks have gone by
and the turmoil in my mind
has done nothing but amplify.

I yearn for that day,
where all seemed hopefull.
Wishing time away, as they say.

With everyone around me
somehow, someway
holding up their worlds so easily.

And I'm down here
struggling continously
amidst all the fear.

For now, I continue to hope.
Carrying on my days
struggling to cope.

Reason/Description:
A couple weeks on from starting to write the first poem. I found myself in more trouble of my own brains doing. I wanted to continue writing within the same poem but it felt like there should be a break to account for the time that's passed.

Metres:
3 line stanzas where first and last line must rhyme.
