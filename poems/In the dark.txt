In the dark

Sometimes I'll walk in the dark
through the alleyways
and country roads.

Those paths without lights,
just so when I pass other people
They can't see my face.

They don't see the tears run
down my cheeks
or my bloodshot eyes.

Reason/Description:
While trying to do some DIY around the house, I got overwhelmed with all the numbers being spoken in my head and through other mouths. Sometimes, this happens all to easily but I'd like to think it's a rarity. Since I could no longer progress through the task at hand, I was lost on what to move to, so I simply moved. I went out in the winter eve, all dark and dressed. After a few minutes, I was rolling through thoughts of how furstrating and sad the situation I found myself in.
