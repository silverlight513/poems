Working title: Reading

1.
Under the covers on a sunday morning.
Book in hand and my dog
lying comfortably at my side.   

2.


The sun shines in filling the room
With that golden warmth
As if it is your own personal fireplace.

3.
As the pages get turned
The sun shies away
Hiding behind clouds
As if I've scared it away

4.
I apologise and hope
That it'll come to greet me again
And share it's warmth with me
So I can enjoy a moment again.

Reason/Description:
I had been having a couple difficult weeks. Lots of ups and downs dealing with emotional dysregulation. I'd been trying a few different methods of action within these weeks with varying success. For this week my method included reading, something I very rarely do and after around 30 minutes of reading, I wrote down the first draft of this. I liked the allegory between my mental state and the clouds, causing problems for the sun (my happiness).
