Stone and timber fantasies

Feudal fairy tales aglow

The weight of time abraded

Reason/Description:
I want to do a more in detail descriptive piece. I enjoyed writing about the humming bird photo so I thought, let's do another. This time, about a photo I've taken in a place I enjoy. https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj1jtJHlFru/. This place is often referred to as a fairy tale caslte since it was rebuilt to be a second home for the 3rd Marquess of Bute in the 19th century.
