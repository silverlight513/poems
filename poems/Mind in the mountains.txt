Working title: Mind in the mountains

1.
These monolithic giants standing overcast
To infant beings stood, transfixed at their contrast
2.
Burdening is time that weighs down on stubborn rock
If nature eroded swift wreaking havoc shock

1.
Amidst parting walls, step through the breach uncharted
Endless spires and wild rolling hills grasp unbounded
2.
Soothing peace amongst these overcasting towers <replace overcasting (eclipsing)>
As winds roll clouds over edge like creeping rivers

1.
Honey emerald hills unfold to another
Til struck by sheer grey cliffs set by concrete boulder
2.
Mossy waterfalls crashing to low valley floors
To entwining streams coursing to distant seashores

1.
For this place is where I wish to be surrounded
Fleeing humanity for it's overcrowded
2.
So few times am I at peace, so few am I here
In my dreams do those mountains so often appear

1.
Waking from slumberous sleep no longer afraid
Anxieties grip now waning for worries fade
2.
Desperate cravings to fall back into repose
Let it take me, let me feel that physical prose

Reason/Description:
Trying to think of topics to write about and I thought, what do I love the most. After writing a couple more troubling poems it would be nice to write something heartfelt instead of heartwrenching.


Metres:
12 syllable rhyming couplets
2 couplets per stanza
5 stanzas
each couplet is a juxtaposition

Couplet topics:
1.
The intensity of overshadowing monolithic mountaints
The infancy of a single man cast under
2.
How slow nature forms into greatness
A terrifying thought if nature was quick and cast

1.
Step through the breach, a small opening between
Opening into the wide vastness of mountains
2.
Still life, no living animal in sight
Fierce, fast, fumbling clouds fly past clipping mountain tops

1.
Rolling luscious green slopes
Sheer grey cliff faces
2.
Mossy waterfalls crashing down rocks
Gentle streams through valley floors

1.
Time to take such standing mountiains
Such a young creature standing in adore
2.
To respect that, that is great and old. Time forged
To know you're just a blip, you're one small part of nature

1.
A dream that drowns my worries
Waking up to know I'm not in that calm embrace
2.
Desparately trying to fall back asleep
Let it take you, the calmness of the mountains, bring you to your sleep


Stanza topics:
Coming to the mountains in gobsmacked awe
Heading through the mountains and finding it's wonders
Noticing the drastic differences in the beauty
Coming out the other side wiser (more at one with nature/more respectful of natures beauty)
Alas, it was all a dream, I want to fall asleep and be there again
