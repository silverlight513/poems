Finished:

Reason/Description:
Trying to think of topics to write about and I thought, what do I love the most. After writing a couple more troubling poems it would be nice to write something heartfelt instead of heartwrenching.


Metres:
12 syllable rhyming couplets
2 couplets per stanza
5 stanzas
each couplet is a juxtaposition

Couplet topics:
1.
The intensity of overshadowing monolithic mountaints
The infancy of a single man cast under
2.
How slow nature forms into greatness
A terrifying thought if nature was quick and cast

1.
Step through the breach, a small opening between
Opening into the wide vastness of mountains
2.
Still life, no living animal in sight
Fierce, fast, fumbling clouds fly past clipping mountain tops

1.
Rolling luscious green slopes
Sheer grey cliff faces
2.
Mossy waterfalls crashing down rocks
Gentle streams through valley floors

1.
Old aged, carved over time
Such a young creature standing in adore
2.
To respect that, that is great and old. Time forged
To know you're just a blip, you're one small part of nature

1.
A dream that drowns my worries
Waking up to know I'm not in that calm embrace
2.
Desparately trying to fall back asleep
Let it take you, the calmness of the mountains, bring you to your sleep


Stanza topics:
Coming to the mountains in gobsmacked awe
Heading through the mountains and finding it's wonders
Noticing the drastic differences in the beauty
Coming out the other side wiser (more at one with nature/more respectful of natures beauty)
Alas, it was all a dream, I want to fall asleep and be there again
