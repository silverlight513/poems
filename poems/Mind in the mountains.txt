Working title: Mind in the mountains

1.
These monolithic giants standing overcast
To infant beings stood, transfixed at their contrast
2.
Burdening is time that weighs down on stubborn rock
If nature eroded swift wreaking havoc shock

1.
Amidst parting walls, step through the breach uncharted
Endless spires and wild rolling hills grasp unbounded
2.
Soothing peace to be amongst eclipsing towers
As winds roll clouds over edge like creeping rivers

1.
Honey emerald hills unfold to another
Til struck by sheer grey cliffs set by concrete boulder
2.
Mossy waterfalls crashing to low valley floors
To entwining streams coursing to distant seashores

1.
For this place is where I wish to be surrounded
Fleeing humanity for it's overcrowded
2.
So few times am I at peace, so few am I here <few???>
But in my dreams do those mountains often appear

1.
Buried in slumberous sleep no longer afraid
Anxieties grip now waning as worries fade
2.
Desperate cravings to fall back into repose
Let it take me, let me feel that physical prose

Reason/Description:
Trying to think of topics to write about and I thought, what do I love the most. After writing a couple more troubling poems it would be nice to write something heartfelt instead of heartwrenching. I also recently learnt what juxtaposition is after doing some research on poetry styles. I thought it might be fun to try out writing something where each couplet was a juxtaposition (some may be a bit weak)


Metres:
12 syllable rhyming couplets
2 couplets per stanza
5 stanzas
each couplet is a juxtaposition

Stanza topics:
Coming to the mountains in gobsmacked awe
Heading through the mountains and finding it's wonders
Noticing the drastic differences in the beauty
Coming out the other side wiser (more at one with nature/more respectful of natures beauty)
Alas, it was all a dream, I want to fall asleep and be there again
