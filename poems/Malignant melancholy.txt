Malignant melancholy

The malignant melancholy that
Saps your already aching feet.
One step in front of another.
One task upon another.

An endless droning drum
That becomes your 
Never ending earworm
Pulling at your heels.

Hardening your knuckles,
Heavy-ing your eyes.
Tired and weary,
You make it up the street.

Turn the corner
To a new road. 
A new task, all the same.
Your suspended tragedy.

Reason/Description:
Over the past couple years, since I'd been going to therapy, I've been trying to slow down my life as a way of keeping my ADHD in check. If I get okay with the pain of boredom, the irrationality, impulsiveness and speed slow down. This poem came about by thinking of the monotony of a life with just the painful boredom.
