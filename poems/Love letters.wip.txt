Reason/Description:
My partner and I were watching a new Netflix film called the half of it and throughout the film they had philosophical quotes about what is love. It got me thinking about what I consider love. After writing down a few variations, I thought it would make a nice little poem.
Ater a little work, I was reading over the first few lines and found it played better as a description of love letters so I've decided to roll with it.

Starting Prose:
Love cannot be described to perfection
A feeling that we all experience differently
But to explain it, it might be something like this
Love is the desire for happiness in unity
The comfort of not needing anything more from another
