The abandoned bay

Flattened silky waves, no crest caves
No sailboats waking water waves
Movement forbidden so sails stowed
Forsaken flags left to erode
Disappeared is the buzzing sound
Missing patrons from all around
No actors left for roaring plays
Doused light in abandoned cafes
No rushing cyclists clipping by
aged couples now seemingly shy
Deserted civilisation
Encompasing segregation
A community with no admission
This abandoned bay forgotten

Reason/Description:
Struggling to think of usual topics for a poem in the midst of a global pandemic. Trying not to be clich√© about the current situation and thinking what I can write about. Considering I find the most joy in writing what I'm feeling I caved and decided to write the sights I've seen every day for the past couple weeks.

Metres:
 - 8 syllable lines
 - Couplets with end rhymes
 - 6 couplets

Couplet topics:
No boats to make waves, such still water
Empty floating walkways on marinas 
No more buzzing restaurants and bars
No more passers by

Topics:
Silent docks
Still water
Empty marina
quiet streets (no more people at bars and restaurants)
No whizzing cyclists 
No elderly couples taking sun soaked walks along the barage
