Working title: Fading worries

There's peace at treacherous tides.
For time holds still in presence of mezmerous views
Ontop of pebble cliffs.
Silently we sit.
Listening;
To crashing crescents imploding
To thunderous storms applauding.

Reason/Description:
I was sitting on the pebble beach with the waves crashing into the hill of pebbles below and realized, all my worries fade and nothing exists anymore but the waves, the lights and the stary night sky.


Metres:
None, this is my first freeform poem. After reading a lot of recently made poetry, it turns out no one uses metres anymore.
