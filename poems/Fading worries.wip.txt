Working title: Fading worries

There's peace at treacherous tides.
For time holds still in the presence of mezmerous views,
ontop of pebble cliffs,
silently I sit.
Listening;
To crashing crescents imploding
To thunderous storms applauding.
The perfect perch to slay
those thoughts that lead me astray.

Reason/Description:
I was sitting on the pebble beach with the waves crashing into the hill of pebbles below and realized, all my worries fade and nothing exists anymore but the waves, the lights and the stary night sky.


Metres:
None, this is my first freeform poem. After reading a lot of recently made poetry, it turns out no one uses metres anymore.
