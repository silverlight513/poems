Working title: Panic

1.
On the busy streets,
Stranded and trapped.
I'm screaming so loud
and the people walk past
but they don't see the pain.
The roars that rear inside my head.

2.
My chest constricts and binds
So tight that I cannot breathe.
The deprived barren void of my lungs
toil for any breathe they can achieve.
Grasping for any gasp I can.

3.
I claw at myself.
Hoping my talons pierce my skin
so that the pain has somewhere to go.
To flood out of me,
so that I can be free.

4.
Soon enough comes the exhaustion.
The point at which you lose the fight
and give into the pain.
The moment when you can do nothing.
Nothing at all.

Reason/Description:
I was reading Savannah Brown's first poem in her second collection. It started to fill me with the feeling of anxiety so I stopped and started this about how my worst attacks have felt. Some poems just wack me with all sorts of unrelated feelings.

Stanza topics:
Screaming inside my head / silent and ignored in reality
The tightness of my chest. Deprived of air.
I want to scratch a hole in my body so I can let the pain out
Eventually being so exhausted that I stare and loose myself in a void
