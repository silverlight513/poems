Working title: Anxiety

1.
I'm in the middle of the city
and I'm screaming.
No one can hear me.
The people walk past
but they don't see my pain.
// Cynghanedd here about the loudness of the pain inside my head

2.
My chest constricts and binds
So tight that I cannot breathe.
The deprived barren void of my lungs
toil for any breathe they can.
// Cynghanedd about gasping for air. The mouth trying and the lungs rejecting

3.
I claw at myself.
Hoping my talons pierce my skin
so that the pain has somewhere to go.
To flood out of me,
so that I can be free // Need to turn this into a cynghanedd

4.
Soon enough comes the exhaustion.
The point at which you lose the fight
and give into the pain.
The moment when you can do nothing.
Nothing at all. // Need to turn this into a cynghanedd

Finished:

Reason/Description:
I was reading Savannah Brown's first poem in her second collection. It started to fill me with the feeling of anxiety so I stoped and started this about how my worst attacks have felt.

Metres:
End each stanza in a cynghanedd

Stanza topics:
Screaming inside my head / silent and ignored in reality
The tightness of my chest. Deprived of air.
I want to scratch a hole in my body so I can let the pain out
Eventually being so exhausted that I stare and loose myself in a void
