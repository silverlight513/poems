Finished:

Structure:
Two end rhyming couplets per stanza
11 syllables per line

Couplet topics:

- The quiteness, the calm and comfort of your favorite people
- Maybe they don't come as often as you'd like
- Maybe they're hard to find
- Once you've found the right people, the calm comes

1. 
Enveloped and surrounded by sky touch mountains
Consumed by calmness in these peaceful surroundings

2.
Today in sunkissed hillsides, are moments rare
Solitude and intimacy, here we share

3.
Present, here and now, often a dream long forgotten
Come and go are these moments, never that common

4.
Paths and roads all unfamiliar have me lead astray
Unable to reach that desired place today

5.
When you reach the peak, becoming satisfaction
Peaceful and silent are these kind times ??? Not enough syllabels
